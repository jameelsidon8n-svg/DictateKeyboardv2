/**
 * Hosting locations for the community prompt library (issue #105).
 *
 * Same zero-ops, self-hosted pattern as the glide dictionaries and Whisper models: a single static
 * JSON file lives on the project's own repository, and the app fetches it on demand (only when the
 * user opens the library browser — never on launch). No third-party service is involved.
 *
 * The library lives on its own orphan branch [BRANCH] rather than in a release asset, so community
 * members can extend it with an ordinary pull request against [LIBRARY_PATH] without the maintainer
 * having to cut a release for every added prompt.
